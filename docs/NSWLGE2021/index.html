<h1>2021 NSW local government election companion site</h1>
<h2>by Andrew Conway and Vanessa Teague</h2>

<p>This is a companion website for
our <a href="https://github.com/AndrewConway/ConcreteSTV/blob/main/reports/NSWLGE2021Report.pdf">report</a>
on the possible effects of iVote on the 2021 NSW local government election.</p>

<p>You may <a href="../Viewer.html?list=NSWLGE2021/changes/list.json">see</a>
    details on added or altered votes sufficient to have changed the outcome of the
election. We are not making any claim about what <em>did</em> happen
    - we simply quantify the size of sufficient changes, using the data made
    available by NSWEC. </p>
