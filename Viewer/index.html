<h1>Analysis of Election Data</h1>
<h2>by Andrew Conway and Vanessa Teague</h2>

<p>This site gives background details for our analysis of election outcomes.
    You can generally reproduce these results yourself using the programs
    in the git repository
    <a href="https://github.com/AndrewConway/ConcreteSTV">https://github.com/AndrewConway/ConcreteSTV</a>
    or just quickly look at the results here.</p>

<h3>2020 ACT election</h3>

In our <a href="https://github.com/AndrewConway/ConcreteSTV/blob/main/reports/2020%20Errors%20In%20ACT%20Counting.pdf">report</a>
we show three classes of bugs that could in principle change election outcomes
in the ACT vote counting code that cropped up in the 2020 election. Elections ACT acknowledged
two of the bug classes, and fixed all three and recounted the election in 2021.

<h3>Federal Senate elections 2013-2019</h3>

In our <a href="https://github.com/AndrewConway/ConcreteSTV/blob/main/reports/RecommendedAmendmentsSenateCountingAndScrutiny.pdf">report</a>
we show one clear class of bug and two bizarre changes in count algorithm between the 2013, 2016 and 2019 elections where at least one
of them was wrong. The end result was changing the legislation to match the AEC's program.

<h3>NSW Local Government election 2021</h3>

In our <a href="TODO">report</a>
we show problems with many more electorates due to iVote than the NSW electoral commission acknowledges.
