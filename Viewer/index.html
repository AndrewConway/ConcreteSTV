<h1>Analysis of Election Data</h1>
<h2>by Andrew Conway and Vanessa Teague</h2>

<p>This site gives background details for our analysis of election outcomes.
    You can generally reproduce these results yourself using the programs
    in the git repository
    <a href="https://github.com/AndrewConway/ConcreteSTV">https://github.com/AndrewConway/ConcreteSTV</a>
    or just quickly look at the results here.</p>

<h3>2020 ACT election</h3>

In our <a href="https://github.com/AndrewConway/ConcreteSTV/blob/main/reports/2020%20Errors%20In%20ACT%20Counting.pdf">report</a>
we show three classes of bugs that could in principle change election outcomes
in the ACT vote counting code. These cropped up in the 2020 election. Elections ACT acknowledged
two of the bug classes, and fixed all three and recounted the election in 2021.

<h3>Federal Senate elections 2013-2019</h3>

In our <a href="https://github.com/AndrewConway/ConcreteSTV/blob/main/reports/RecommendedAmendmentsSenateCountingAndScrutiny.pdf">report</a>
we show one clear class of bug related to tiebreaking and two bizarre changes in count algorithm between the 2013, 2016 and 2019 elections.
None of these impacted the choice of winner, but they did affect totals and could have impacted winners in future.
The end result was a <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r6810">legislative change</a>
to bring the requirements into line with the AEC's implementation, and also to introduce an audit of the paper ballots.  We are delighted that this law
received multi-party support.

<h3>NSW Local Government election 2021</h3>

Our <a href="TODO">report</a> examines the size of missing or altered votes that would be
sufficient for iVote's security or performance issues to have impacted the election results.
A <a href="NSWLGE2021">companion web site</a> details the examples from the paper.
